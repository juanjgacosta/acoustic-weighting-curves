## Intro

The sound pressure measurement are weighted to represent the human earâ€™s sensitivity as a function of frequencies. 

Three commonly used acoustic weighting curves are A, C, and Z.

Negative weighting values are associated with low-frequency sounds in the range of 20 Hz to 1 kHz, as the human ear is much less sensitive to low-frequency than higher-frequency sounds in the range of 1 kHz to 4 kHz
